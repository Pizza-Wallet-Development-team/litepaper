                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p >      
                    <span>It’s for you</span> if you want all your crypto requirements met at a single place with the most user-friendly crypto experience out there, <span>but it’s also for you</span> if you’re not too familiar with the crypto space yet and want your crypto journey to be as fun as eating a slice of pizza.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Around pizza, Neapolitans do not only feel comfortable but also get a very easy going vibe when approaching their warm, authentic and simple core food. Eating a pizza is lived as a true experience where ingredients from around the world, from the tradition and the contemporary meet together to give life to something in constant evolution. Pizza is like a metaphor of life, always transforming.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is why pizza is at the core of our development, as we want Pizza wallet’s user experience to be as fun, easy and family as eating a slice of pizza.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Pizza wallet, users are presented with the option to choose how they want to sign up - by email, familiar social ids or with a secure seed phrase.The ease of Web2 and the security of Web3. Best of both worlds, isn’t it?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s not your regular wallet though. With Pizza wallet, you can do pretty much everything that you currently have to use multiple platforms for, such as exchanging your fiat for crypto and vice versa, making transactions on multiple chains, storing your crypto, etc. Why go through the struggle of finding multiple platforms when all of it can simply be done at one single place?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We believe that crypto usage should be inclusive, accessible and easy to use by everyone and for that to happen, the onboarding and the transacting process has to be simplified which is exactly what we are aiming at Pizza wallet.

                We are tapping into this huge community worldwide by integrating crypto use cases in one of the most popular and familiar things to eat - pizza - for onboarding the next 1 million people to Web3.

                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                The first step towards getting into crypto or Web3 in general is creating a wallet. Though currently if some novice decides to do that, it leaves them confused and disappointed. Why? It appears to be a totally alien place with dozens of technical jargons that people don’t understand. In fact the process of signing up itself is too technical with so many security checkpoints.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once users have managed to set up a hot wallet, next they have to undergo a continuous decision making process of choosing among multiple platforms and multiple chains. And it doesn’t just end there. When you have to use one platform for buying crypto with your fiat and another for swapping it, and then yet another to store it or turn it back to fiat, everything starts to feel like a tedious task if you’re not already used to it. Not to mention that not every platform supports multiple chains. So since none of this is integrated well, it gets hard to navigate through even for those who’ve been doing this for a while.
                <br>
                <br>
                It would’ve still been better if only there were enough supportive communities to guide you through but that’s not the case either.
                <br>
                <br>
                All in all, crypto comes off as a complicated space made only for the nerds and even the nerds can find it complex sometimes. This notion is lethal to the growth of this space. If we’re striving for mass adoption of Web3 and crypto, the onboarding process has to change for the better.
